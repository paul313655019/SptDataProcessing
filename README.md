- **plotly**: For interactive visualizations.
- **plotly-resampler**: For resampling large datasets in Plotly visualizations.
- **holoviews**: For high-level data visualization.
- **SciPy**: For scientific computing and advanced mathematical functions.
- **lmfit**: For curve fitting and optimization.

- **nbformat**: For Jupyter notebook formatting.
- **pyarrow**: For reading and writing data in various formats.

## Columns

The reading is done from a CSV file which is output from TrackMate (ImageJ plugin).
The typical column names are separated by underscores which I removed for simplicity.
Some prefixes are also removed to make the column names more readable.
For example, `TRACK_ID` becomes `TrackID`, `POSITION_X` becomes `X`, etc.

The other columns are added after each analysis is applied to the data.
