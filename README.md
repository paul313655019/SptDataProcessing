## Columns

The reading is done from a CSV file which is output from TrackMate (ImageJ plugin).
The typical column names are separated by underscores which I removed for simplicity.
Some prefixes are also removed to make the column names more readable.
For example, `TRACK_ID` becomes `TrackID`, `POSITION_X` becomes `X`, etc.

The other columns are added after each analysis is applied to the data.
